A IntelliJ IDEA plugin that displays file statistics in the status bar.

## Description

Statly shows the **number of lines, character count, and file size** for the currently selected file directly in the IDE's status bar. This helps developers quickly see file metrics without opening external tools or checking the file properties manually.

## Features

* Display **line count** of the currently selected file.
* Display **character count** of the currently selected file.
* Display **file size** in a human-readable format (B, KB, MB).

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/statly.git
   ```
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
3. Build and run the plugin using **Run → Edit Configurations → Plugin**.

## Usage

Once installed, open any file in your project. The status bar at the bottom will show:

```
characters:lines / size
```

For example:

```
1024:50 / 1.0 KB
```
